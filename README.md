# üß† CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Transfer Learning (VGG16)

This project implements image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using **transfer learning** with a pre-trained **VGG16** model. The goal is to leverage powerful deep features from VGG16 (trained on ImageNet) and adapt it to classify small 32x32 images into 10 categories.

## üìö Dataset: CIFAR-10
CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset for image classification, containing **60,000 32x32 color images** in **10 classes**, with 6,000 images per class.

**Classes**:
- airplane
- automobile
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse
- ship
- truck

## üîß Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Transfer Learning Strategy**:
  - All convolutional layers **frozen**
  - Custom **fully connected classifier head** added on top
- **Classifier Head**:
  - Global Average Pooling
  - Dense (512 units, ReLU)
  - Dropout (0.5)
  - Dense (10 units, Softmax)
